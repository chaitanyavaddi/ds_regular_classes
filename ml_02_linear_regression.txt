Linear Regression:
This is a machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous
numerical value by learning relationship between input features
and the target. 

Why?
Eg.1
- Bigger house -> higher price
- Smaller house -> lower price
- House price = (size * rate) + base_price (we manually give formula)
- But here LR learns this formula from data, not from rules

Eg.2
- More experience -> more salary
Linear regression answers "What is salary expectation for a 6 years experienced?"


Maths behind LR:
y = mx + c
y -> prediction (target / label)
x -> Input feature
m -> slope (how much y changes when x increases)
c -> intercept (base value when x = 0)

ML terminology
x (Feature), y (Target / Label), m (weight / Coefficient), c (Bias / intercept)

When?
- Target is continous
- Relation is linear (roughly)
- Dataset is small to medium (Avoid too many outliers)

What?
- Minimize prediction error
- Find the line that makes overall error smallest

Code Eg.
Problem: Predict tip amount based on total amount


import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/refs/heads/master/tips.csv")

X = df[['total_bill']] #feature
Y = df['tip'] #label

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test =  train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

#Train the model with linear regression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
print(model.predict(X_test))

#This error is measured with MAE 
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score
print("MAE:", mean_absolute_error(Y_test, model.predict(X_test)))
print("Slope:", model.coef_) # For every Rs.1 increase in bill, tip increases by Rs X
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_) # "Base tip amount"

Multiple features:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/refs/heads/master/tips.csv")

X = df[['total_bill']] #feature
Y = df['tip'] #label

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test =  train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

#Train the model with linear regression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
print(model.predict(X_test))

#This error is measured with MAE 
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score
print("MAE:", mean_absolute_error(Y_test, model.predict(X_test)))
print("Slope:", model.coef_) # For every Rs.1 increase in bill, tip increases by Rs X
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_) # "Base tip amount"

#formula = m1x1 + m2x2 + c
