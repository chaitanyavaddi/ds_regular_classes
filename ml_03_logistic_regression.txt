Def: Logistic Regression
This is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to 
predict a categorical outcome (usually Yes / No) by estimating probabilties. 

- It predicts the probability of something happening, and then 
converts that probability into a class

Why?
Eg. 1: Loan Approval
Input:
- Income, Credit score, Age, existing loans
Output:
- Loan Approved? yes or no

Logistic Regression answers 
- what is the probability that this person will replay the loan?

Eg.2: Disease prediction
Inputs: Age, BP, Sugar Level 
Output: Disease present? yes or No

Eg 3: Spam detection 


What?
It outputs probability btw 0 and 1

Example:
- 0.93 -> very likely 'yes'
- 0.12 -> very likely 'no'


How?
z = w1x1 + w2x2 + b
probability = sigmoid(z) 
The function maps any real-valued input \(x\) to an output value 
between 0 and 1 (exclusive). 
This makes it suitable for binary classification 
problems and modeling probabilities.


terminology:
weights - Importance of features
Bias - base tedency
Sigmoid - Probability converter
Threshold - Decision boundary


When?
- Binary classification (yes / No)
- Probablistics output needed
- Small - medium datasets


What?
It learns a decision boudnary
- The boundary seperates 
- class 0
- class 1
