What is ML?

Machine Learning is teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of
giving them step by step instructions. 

In traditional programming, we write rules. In ML, the computer learns rules
from examples. 

- You dont tell ML how to recognize a cat
- You show 10,000 cat photos, ML learn patterns (shape, ears, eyes, texture)

Why do we need ML?
Because humands cannot manually create rules for 
- Large datasets, Complex patterns, fast changing env

Where? - Real Life Examples:
- Netflix - movie recommendations (ML learns your behaviour & predict what you will watch next)
- Google Maps - Travel time prediction (Ml learns from past trips to estimate ETA)
- Banks - Fraud detection (ML flags unsual activity based on learned patterns)
- Amazon - prouct recommendations (ML analyzes millions of user actions)
- Uber - Surge pricing (ML predicts demand -> increase price automatically)
- Instagram - Feed ranking (ML learns what content you like)
- Hospitals - Disease prediction (ML predicts diabetes or heart issues from medical records)
- Finance - credit scoring (ML predicts who is like to repay a loan)


The Core Formula of ML:

Input Data -> ML Algorithm -> Model -> Predictions

Ex: data -> size, location, rooms; Model -> Lienar regression; prediction: House price


Analogy:
- Show many examples
- The child finds patterns
- The child tries new examples
- If wrong -> correct and learn
- After corrections -> becomes accurate

ML works exactly the same but with math. 

Maching Learning Terms:

- Feature (Input variable)
-- Information used for prediction
-- Example (House price prediction).
-- Size -> Feature
-- Location -> Feature
-- Number of rooms -> Feature

- Label / Target
-- What you want to predict?
-- House price
-- Disease risk
-- Will customer buy?

- Training Data
-- Historical data with features + labels

- Model 
-- The brain the ML creates. 

- Prediction
-- The output of the model

- Error / Loss
-- How wrong the prediciton is?

- Underfitting
-- Model learns too little -> cannot capture patterns


Machine Learning Types:
1. Supervised Learning
-- Model learns from labeled data. 
-- Photos labeled cat or dog
-- Fraud vs not Fraud
-- Price prediction

Eg. Teacher gives question -> also gives correct answer -> stduent learns
-- Regression -> predicting numbers
-- Classification -> predicting categories

2. Unsupervised Learning
-- Model learns patterns without labels
-- group similar customers
-- cluster similar songs
-- Identify unusual behavior

Eg. Students automatically group themselves based on interests -> no instructions are given
-- clustering, dimensionality reduction (PCA)

3. Reinforcement Learning
-- Model learns by trail and error
-- Self driving cards
-- Robots
-- Game AI (chess, etc..)

Eg. A child learns to walk by falling -> correcting -> retrying



Ten Step Machine Leaning Pipeline: 
1. Understand the problem
2. Collect data
3. Clean data (pandas)
4. Explore data (EDA)
5. Feature Engineering
6. Split Data
7. Choose ML Algorithm
8. Train the Model
9. Evaluate the Model
10. Deploy the Model
