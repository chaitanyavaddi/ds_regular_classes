What is ML?

Machine Learning is teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of
giving them step by step instructions. 

In traditional programming, we write rules. In ML, the computer learns rules
from examples. 

- You dont tell ML how to recognize a cat
- You show 10,000 cat photos, ML learn patterns (shape, ears, eyes, texture)

Why do we need ML?
Because humands cannot manually create rules for 
- Large datasets, Complex patterns, fast changing env

Where? - Real Life Examples:
- Netflix - movie recommendations (ML learns your behaviour & predict what you will watch next)
- Google Maps - Travel time prediction (Ml learns from past trips to estimate ETA)
- Banks - Fraud detection (ML flags unsual activity based on learned patterns)
- Amazon - prouct recommendations (ML analyzes millions of user actions)
- Uber - Surge pricing (ML predicts demand -> increase price automatically)
- Instagram - Feed ranking (ML learns what content you like)
- Hospitals - Disease prediction (ML predicts diabetes or heart issues from medical records)
- Finance - credit scoring (ML predicts who is like to repay a loan)


The Core Formula of ML:

Input Data -> ML Algorithm -> Model -> Predictions

Ex: data -> size, location, rooms; Model -> Lienar regression; prediction: House price


Analogy:
- Show many examples
- The child finds patterns
- The child tries new examples
- If wrong -> correct and learn
- After corrections -> becomes accurate

ML works exactly the same but with math. 

Maching Learning Terms:

- Feature (Input variable)
-- Information used for prediction
-- Example (House price prediction).
-- Size -> Feature
-- Location -> Feature
-- Number of rooms -> Feature

- Label / Target
-- What you want to predict?
-- House price
-- Disease risk
-- Will customer buy?

- Training Data
-- Historical data with features + labels

- Model 
-- The brain the ML creates. 

- Prediction
-- The output of the model

- Error / Loss
-- How wrong the prediciton is?

- Underfitting
-- Model learns too little -> cannot capture patterns


Machine Learning Types:
1. Supervised Learning
-- Model learns from labeled data. 
-- Photos labeled cat or dog
-- Fraud vs not Fraud
-- Price prediction

Eg. Teacher gives question -> also gives correct answer -> stduent learns
-- Regression -> predicting numbers
-- Classification -> predicting categories

2. Unsupervised Learning
-- Model learns patterns without labels
-- group similar customers
-- cluster similar songs
-- Identify unusual behavior

Eg. Students automatically group themselves based on interests -> no instructions are given
-- clustering, dimensionality reduction (PCA)

3. Reinforcement Learning
-- Model learns by trail and error
-- Self driving cards
-- Robots
-- Game AI (chess, etc..)

Eg. A child learns to walk by falling -> correcting -> retrying



Ten Step Machine Leaning Pipeline: 
1. Understand the problem
-- What business probem are we solving?
-- What are we predicting?
Eg. predict customer churn

2. Collect data
- Could come from CSV, APIS, Databases, Sensors, Cloud storage etc.. 

3. Clean data (pandas)
- remove missign calues, fix data types, remove outliers, handle inconsistent text

4. Explore data (EDA)
- Visualizations, summary statistics, correlation etc..

5. Feature Engineering
-- Creating new meaninful features (Eg. a new column in csv)
-- Eg. Convert data into -> date, month, weekday, holiday

6. Split Data
Eg. Imagins stduents preparing for an exam
-- Training set (learn patterns) - all the chapters they study
-- Test set (check performance) - the exam questions
-- If both sets are same -> student gets 100 but leans nothing
-- If both sets are diff -> we see real understanding
Machine learning must also be tested on new data, not thew same data it learned from
-- How much to spit?
-- Most common - 80% training, 20% testing
-- For verr large datasets - 90/10
-- For samller ones - 70/30

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/refs/heads/master/tips.csv")
X = df[['total_bill']] #feature
Y = df['tip'] #label
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test =  train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
print(len(X_train), len(X_test))

Remember:
-- test set must mimic real-world unseen data
-- Too little test data -> unreliable evaluation
-- Never train on the test set
-- random_sate ensures repeatability

7. Choose ML Algorithm
Def: An ML algorithm is a mathematical method the model uses to learn patterns

Why we have these many algorithms? 
You don't use a hammer to fix a laptop or a microsocpe to find a nail
Machine learning also has different tools for different problems

How to choose?

Problem Type                           Algorighthm examples                            Real life examples
Predict a number (regression)          Linear Regression, random forest regression        predict house prices
Predict a category(classification)     Logistic regression, Decision Tree, SVM            predict if customer will churn
Group similar items (Clustering)       KMeans                                             Customer segmenatation
Reduce Dimentionality                  PCA                                                Compress image features



-- Linear Regression
-- Logistic regression
-- Decision Tree
-- Random Forest
-- SVM
-- KMeans
-- PCA

8. Train the Model
-- feed training data to model.

9. Evaluate the Model
-- Accuracy
-- Precision
-- Recall
-- F1 score
-- RMSE
-- MAE

Analogy: checking how well the student wrote the exam.

10. Deploy the Model
-- Use ML in production via:
-- backend - FastAPI, Flask etc..
-- frontend - Streamlit
-- Cloud to host your model



Real world example:
Scenario: Predict which customer will leave a telecom company
Inputs (Features):
-- Number of calls
-- Internet usage
-- Complaints
-- Monthly bill
Output (Label):
will_leave = Yes or No
Ml Learns:
- High bill + low usage -> customer likely to leave
- Many complaints -> customer at risk

Company uses model to:
-- offer discounts
-- provider better service
-- Reduce churn
